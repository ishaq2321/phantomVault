- **Implementation**: Added `encryptionStatus` and `unlockMode` chips to folder display
- **Status Indicators**:
  - `encrypted` (green) - Folder is properly encrypted with AES-256-CBC
  - `decrypted` (default) - Folder is currently unlocked
  - `processing` (yellow) - Encryption/decryption in progress
  - `error` (red) - Encryption operation failed
- **Unlock Mode Indicators**:
  - `temporary` (blue) - Will auto-lock on system events
  - `permanent` (orange) - Permanently unlocked and removed from vault

#### 2. Profile-Specific Vault Management Interface
- **Feature**: Dedicated vault management dialog with statistics and operations
- **Components**:
  - Vault statistics display (total folders, encrypted count, storage size)
  - Vault operations panel (integrity check, compact, backup, repair)
  - Real-time vault status monitoring
- **Integration**: Accessible via "Manage Vault" button in folder section

#### 3. Unlock Mode Selection GUI
- **Feature**: Modal dialog for selecting unlock mode with detailed explanations
- **Options**:

  - **Permanent Unlock**: Removes from vault permanently, use with caution
- **UI Elements**: Clear descriptions, visual distinction between modes, confirmation flow

#### 4. Enhanced Folder Operations
- **Feature**: Updated folder operations to use real AES-256-CBC encryption
- **API Integration**: 
  - `lockFolder()` - Real encryption with vault storage
  - `unlockFoldersTemporary()` - Temporary decryption with auto-lock
  - `unlockFoldersPermanent()` - Permanent decryption with vault removal
- **User Feedback**: Success/error messages with detailed encryption information

### ✅ Settings Component Enhancements

#### 1. Recovery Key Display and Management
- **Feature**: Comprehensive recovery key management interface
- **Components**:
  - Current recovery key display (with authentication)
  - New recovery key generation with AES-256 encryption
  - Recovery key validation interface
  - Copy to clipboard functionality
- **Security Features**:
  - Password authentication required to view current key
  - Clear indication of AES-256-CBC encryption with PBKDF2
  - Secure key generation with cryptographic randomness

#### 2. Password Change Options
- **Feature**: Master password change with automatic recovery key regeneration
- **Components**:
  - Profile selection dropdown
  - Current/new password fields with validation
  - Automatic new recovery key generation
  - Security warnings and confirmations
- **Validation**:
  - Minimum password length (8 characters)
  - Password confirmation matching
  - Current password verification

#### 3. Enhanced Security Information
- **Feature**: Detailed security feature explanations
- **Information Displayed**:
  - AES-256-CBC encryption details
  - PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
  - Cryptographically secure random generation
  - Master key recovery capabilities
- **Platform Features**: Updated platform guide with real encryption features

### ✅ IPC API Enhancements

#### 1. New Vault Operations Endpoints
- `lockFolder(profileId, folderPath, masterKey)` - Real AES encryption
- `unlockFoldersTemporary(profileId, masterKey)` - Temporary decryption
- `unlockFoldersPermanent(profileId, masterKey, folderIds)` - Permanent decryption
- `getVaultStats(profileId)` - Vault statistics and status

#### 2. Enhanced Recovery Operations
- `generateRecoveryKey(profileId)` - AES-256 encrypted key generation
- `getCurrentRecoveryKey(profileId, masterKey)` - Authenticated key retrieval
- `changePassword(profileId, currentPassword, newPassword)` - Password change with new recovery key

#### 3. TypeScript Definitions
- Complete type definitions for all new API methods
- Global window interface declarations
- Proper error handling and response types

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Folder Encryption Workflow
1. **Setup**: Create a test profile and authenticate
2. **Action**: Add a folder using the enhanced "Encrypt & Secure" button
3. **Verification**: 
   - Folder shows "encrypted" status
   - Vault statistics update correctly
   - Original folder is properly hidden
4. **Expected Result**: Folder is encrypted with AES-256-CBC and stored in vault

### Scenario 2: Unlock Mode Selection
1. **Setup**: Have encrypted folders in a profile
2. **Action**: Click "Unlock Folders" button
3. **Verification**:
   - Modal dialog appears with two clear options
   - Temporary unlock explanation is clear
   - Permanent unlock shows warning
4. **Expected Result**: User can make informed choice about unlock mode

### Scenario 3: Vault Management
1. **Setup**: Profile with multiple encrypted folders
2. **Action**: Open "Manage Vault" dialog
3. **Verification**:
   - Statistics show correct folder count and sizes
   - Operations panel provides maintenance options
   - Real-time status updates work
4. **Expected Result**: Complete vault management interface is functional

### Scenario 4: Recovery Key Management
1. **Setup**: Authenticated profile in settings
2. **Action**: Generate new recovery key
3. **Verification**:
   - New AES-256 encrypted key is generated
   - Security information is displayed
   - Copy to clipboard works
4. **Expected Result**: Secure recovery key management is available

### Scenario 5: Password Change Workflow
1. **Setup**: Profile with existing password
2. **Action**: Change master password
3. **Verification**:
   - Current password validation works
   - New password meets requirements
   - New recovery key is automatically generated
4. **Expected Result**: Password changed with new recovery key

## Security Considerations

### 1. Data Protection
- Master keys are not stored in GUI state longer than necessary
- Recovery keys are only displayed when explicitly requested
- Clipboard operations are secure and temporary

### 2. User Education
- Clear explanations of encryption features
- Security warnings for permanent operations
- Platform-specific capability information

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of service communication failures
- Clear error messages for encryption failures
- Fallback options when advanced features unavailable

## Compatibility

### 1. Backward Compatibility
- Legacy folder operations still supported
- Existing profiles work with new features
- Graceful degradation for older service versions

### 2. Platform Support
- Enhanced features work on Linux, Windows, macOS
- Platform-specific capabilities properly detected
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported features

## Performance Considerations

### 1. UI Responsiveness
- Encryption operations don't block UI
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Efficient vault statistics loading

### 2. Memory Management
- Sensitive data cleared from memory promptly
- Efficient handling of large folder lists
- Optimized vault status updates

## Conclusion

Task 12 successfully enhances the GUI components to support all the advanced encryption features implemented in Phase 1. The interface provides:

- **Complete encryption workflow** with real AES-256-CBC encryption
- **Intuitive vault management** with comprehensive statistics and operations
- **Secure recovery key management** with proper authentication
- **Enhanced user experience** with clear explanations and warnings
- **Professional security interface** matching enterprise standards

The GUI now provides a complete, user-friendly interface for the advanced encryption capabilities, making PhantomVault accessible to both technical and non-technical users while maintaining the highest security standards.
