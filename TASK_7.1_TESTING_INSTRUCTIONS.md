# Task 7.1 Manual Testing Instructions
## Integrate Electron GUI with Unified Service

### Overview
This task integrates the existing Electron GUI with the unified PhantomVault service, adding system tray integration, protocol handling, and desktop shortcuts.

### Prerequisites
- PhantomVault unified service built and available at `bin/phantomvault`
- Node.js and npm installed for GUI development
- Admin/root privileges for testing system integration features

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Build the GUI:**
   ```bash
   cd gui
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the development environment:**
   ```bash
   cd gui
   npm run dev
   ```

### Manual Testing Procedures

#### Test 1: Service Integration and Startup
**Objective:** Verify the GUI properly starts and communicates with the unified service

**Steps:**
1. Start the GUI application: `cd gui && npm run dev`

- ✅ Dashboard shows service status as "Running"
- ✅ No connection errors in console

**Verification:**
- Console shows: `[INFO] 🚀 PhantomVault service started successfully`
- Console shows: `[INFO] 📡 IPC server listening on port 9876`
- Dashboard displays green "Running" status chip

#### Test 2: System Tray Integration
**Objective:** Verify system tray functionality and service status monitoring

**Steps:**
1. With the GUI running, look for PhantomVault icon in system tray
2. Click the tray icon to show/hide the main window
3. Right-click the tray icon to open context menu
4. Test "Hide to Tray" button in the dashboard
5. Test "Show Dashboard" from tray menu
6. Test service restart from tray menu

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Tray icon appears in system tray
- ✅ Left-click toggles window visibility

- ✅ Successful responses with proper JSON data
- ✅ Error handling when service is unavailable
- ✅ Service status updates in real-time

**Verification:**
- Console shows HTTP requests: `[Main] HTTP GET request: http://127.0.0.1:9876/api/profiles`
- Console shows responses: `[Main] HTTP response: { profiles: [], success: true }`

#### Test 4: Protocol Handling
**Objective:** Verify phantomvault:// protocol registration and handling

**Steps:**
1. Open a web browser or terminal
2. Try opening: `phantomvault://show`
3. Try opening: `phantomvault://unlock`
4. Verify the application responds to protocol URLs

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Protocol URLs are recognized by the system
- ✅ PhantomVault application activates when protocol URL is opened
- ✅ Appropriate actions are triggered (show window, unlock prompt)

**Verification:**
- Application window comes to foreground when protocol URL is accessed
- Console shows: `[Main] Handling protocol URL: phantomvault://...`

#### Test 5: Desktop Integration
**Objective:** Verify desktop shortcuts and system integration

**Steps:**
1. Check for desktop shortcut creation (development mode simulation)
2. Verify file association registration
3. Test application startup from system
4. Check Windows/Linux specific integration features

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ System integration completes without errors
- ✅ Application registers as default protocol handler
- ✅ Desktop integration features work as expected

**Verification:**
- Console shows: `[Main] System integration completed`
- Console shows: `[Main] Desktop shortcut creation would happen here`

#### Test 6: Window Management
**Objective:** Verify proper window behavior and lifecycle management

**Steps:**
1. Close the main window (X button)
2. Verify it hides to tray instead of quitting
3. Restore window from tray
4. Test minimize to tray functionality
5. Test proper application quit from tray menu

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Closing window hides to tray (doesn't quit app)
- ✅ Tray notification appears on first hide
- ✅ Window restores properly from tray
- ✅ Application quits properly from tray menu

**Verification:**
- Window disappears but process continues running
- Tray shows balloon notification: "Application was minimized to tray"

#### Test 7: Service Status Monitoring
**Objective:** Verify real-time service status monitoring and updates

**Steps:**
1. Start the application and verify service status
2. Manually stop the service process
3. Observe GUI response to service disconnection
4. Restart service and verify reconnection
5. Test service restart from GUI

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Service status updates in real-time
- ✅ GUI shows appropriate error messages when service is down
- ✅ Tray status updates to reflect service state
