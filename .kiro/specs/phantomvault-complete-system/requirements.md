# Requirements Document

## Introduction

PhantomVault is a comprehensive folder security application that provides invisible folder locking, profile-based management, and keyboard sequence detection for seamless folder access. The system ensures complete folder security by hiding and encrypting folders while maintaining zero traces of their original existence, with multi-profile support and recovery mechanisms.

## Glossary

- **PhantomVault_System**: The complete application including service, GUI, and installer components
- **Profile**: A user context with unique master key, recovery key, and associated secured folders
- **Master_Key**: Primary authentication credential for a specific profile
- **Recovery_Key**: Backup authentication method generated during profile creation or password change
- **Secured_Folder**: A folder that has been locked, encrypted, and hidden from its original location
- **Invisible_Unlock**: Keyboard sequence detection that captures passwords from any user input
- **Admin_Mode**: Running the application with elevated privileges (sudo/admin rights)
- **Keyboard_Logging**: System capability to monitor keyboard input for password detection
- **Temporary_Unlock**: Folders unlocked temporarily that auto-lock on screen lock or re-authentication
- **Permanent_Unlock**: Folders unlocked permanently and removed from profile management
- **Vault_Storage**: Secure location where encrypted folders are stored with backup protection

5. THE PhantomVault_System SHALL support pattern matching (e.g., "Budapest" detected in "I live in Budapest")

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want platform-specific unlock methods when invisible logging is not supported, so that I can still access my folders securely.
