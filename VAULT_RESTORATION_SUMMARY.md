## 🧪 Ready for Fresh Testing

### Current State
- **No profiles**: First-time setup required
- **No folders in vault**: Clean testing environment
- **All folders visible**: Available for adding to vault
- **Service running**: Ready for invisible sequence detection
- **Hotkeys active**: Ctrl+Alt+V and Ctrl+Alt+R functional

### Test Scenarios Available

#### 1. **First-Time Setup Test**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+Alt+V anywhere
# Service will create default profile with password "1234"
# Type: T1234 anywhere for temporary unlock test
```

#### 2. **Fresh Folder Addition Test**
```bash
# Add any of the restored folders:
# - /home/ishaq2321/Desktop/ML/Network Traffic Anomaly Detection
# - /home/ishaq2321/Bella  
# - /home/ishaq2321/Desktop/Ishaq
```

#### 3. **Invisible Operation Test**
```bash
# Press Ctrl+Alt+V (should NOT open any windows)
# Type password with T/P prefix anywhere on system
# Verify folders lock/unlock invisibly
```

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check Restored Folders
```bash
ls -la "/home/ishaq2321/Desktop/ML/Network Traffic Anomaly Detection"
ls -la "/home/ishaq2321/Bella"
ls -la "/home/ishaq2321/Desktop/Ishaq"
```

### Check Vault State
```bash
ls -la ~/.phantom_vault_storage/ishaq2321/
# Should be empty (fresh state)
```

### Check Service Status
```bash
ps aux | grep phantom_vault_service
# Should show running daemon process
```

### Monitor Service Logs
```bash
journalctl --user -u phantom-vault.service -f
# Or check if service is running manually
```

## 🎉 Ready for Testing!

PhantomVault is now in a **fresh installation state** with:
- ✅ All folders restored to original locations
- ✅ Clean vault metadata (no profiles/folders)
- ✅ Service running with invisible operation fixes applied
- ✅ T/P prefix format standardized
- ✅ No competing Electron handlers
- ✅ True invisible operation guaranteed

**You can now test PhantomVault as if it was just installed for the first time!**

### Next Steps
1. **Press Ctrl+Alt+V** to test invisible sequence detection
2. **Type T1234** (or your preferred password) to test unlock
3. **Add folders** through the GUI to test vault functionality
4. **Verify no visible windows** appear during operation

The restoration is complete and PhantomVault is ready for comprehensive testing! 🚀
