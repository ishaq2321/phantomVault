# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GUI Vault Management System provides a user-friendly interface for managing encrypted vaults in PhantomVault. The system enables users to create, configure, monitor, and control their encrypted storage vaults through an intuitive Electron-based desktop application that communicates with the underlying C++ service.

## Glossary

- **PhantomVault**: The complete encrypted storage system including GUI and service components
- **Vault**: An encrypted storage container that can be mounted/unmounted based on keyboard sequences
- **GUI_Application**: The Electron-based desktop interface for vault management
- **Service_Backend**: The C++ service that handles vault operations and keyboard monitoring
- **Vault_Configuration**: Settings that define vault behavior including paths, passwords, and trigger sequences
- **IPC_Channel**: Inter-process communication mechanism between GUI and service
- **Sequence_Detector**: Component that monitors keyboard input for vault trigger sequences
- **Vault_Status**: Current operational state of a vault (mounted, unmounted, error, etc.)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a PhantomVault user, I want to view all my configured vaults in a centralized dashboard, so that I can quickly see the status and manage all my encrypted storage locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI_Application starts, THE GUI_Application SHALL display a dashboard showing all configured vaults
2. THE GUI_Application SHALL show each vault's current status (mounted, unmounted, error)
3. THE GUI_Application SHALL display vault metadata including name, path, and last access time
4. THE GUI_Application SHALL refresh vault status automatically every 5 seconds
5. WHEN a vault status changes, THE GUI_Application SHALL update the display within 2 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a PhantomVault user, I want to create new vaults through the GUI, so that I can easily set up encrypted storage without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks create vault, THE GUI_Application SHALL display a vault creation wizard
2. THE GUI_Application SHALL validate that the specified vault path is accessible and writable
3. THE GUI_Application SHALL ensure the keyboard sequence is unique across all vaults
4. WHEN vault creation is requested, THE GUI_Application SHALL communicate with Service_Backend to create the vault
5. IF vault creation fails, THEN THE GUI_Application SHALL display specific error messages to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a PhantomVault user, I want to edit existing vault configurations, so that I can update passwords, paths, or keyboard sequences as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects edit vault, THE GUI_Application SHALL display current Vault_Configuration settings
2. THE GUI_Application SHALL allow modification of vault path, password, and keyboard sequence
3. THE GUI_Application SHALL validate new keyboard sequences for uniqueness
4. WHEN configuration changes are saved, THE GUI_Application SHALL update Service_Backend configuration
5. THE GUI_Application SHALL require password confirmation for security-sensitive changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a PhantomVault user, I want to manually mount and unmount vaults from the GUI, so that I can control vault access without relying only on keyboard sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GUI_Application SHALL provide mount/unmount buttons for each vault
2. WHEN mount is requested, THE GUI_Application SHALL prompt for vault password if required
3. WHEN unmount is requested, THE GUI_Application SHALL safely unmount the vault through Service_Backend
4. THE GUI_Application SHALL display mount/unmount progress with appropriate feedback
5. IF mount/unmount operations fail, THEN THE GUI_Application SHALL display detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a PhantomVault user, I want to monitor vault activity and logs, so that I can troubleshoot issues and verify vault operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GUI_Application SHALL display recent vault activity in a scrollable log view
2. THE GUI_Application SHALL show timestamps for all vault operations
3. THE GUI_Application SHALL filter log entries by vault and severity level
4. THE GUI_Application SHALL retrieve log data from Service_Backend through IPC_Channel
5. WHEN new log entries are available, THE GUI_Application SHALL update the display automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a PhantomVault user, I want to configure application settings, so that I can customize the behavior and appearance of the vault management interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GUI_Application SHALL provide a settings panel for user preferences
2. THE GUI_Application SHALL allow configuration of auto-start behavior
3. THE GUI_Application SHALL provide options for notification preferences
4. THE GUI_Application SHALL save settings persistently across application restarts
5. WHEN settings are changed, THE GUI_Application SHALL apply changes immediately without restart

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a PhantomVault user, I want the GUI to communicate reliably with the service backend, so that all vault operations work correctly and I receive accurate status information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GUI_Application SHALL establish IPC_Channel connection with Service_Backend on startup
2. THE GUI_Application SHALL detect when Service_Backend becomes unavailable
3. IF IPC_Channel connection fails, THEN THE GUI_Application SHALL display connection status and retry options
4. THE GUI_Application SHALL handle Service_Backend responses within 10 seconds timeout
5. WHEN Service_Backend reconnects, THE GUI_Application SHALL automatically refresh all vault data
