## Creating Your First Profile

### What are Profiles?

Profiles in PhantomVault are isolated security contexts that allow you to:
- Separate personal and work folders
- Use different master passwords
- Maintain independent security settings
- Track usage separately

### Creating a Profile

1. **Launch PhantomVault** and click "Create New Profile"
2. **Enter Profile Details**:
   - **Profile Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "Personal", "Work")
   - **Master Password**: Create a strong password (12+ characters recommended)
   - **Confirm Password**: Re-enter your master password
3. **Save Recovery Key**: Write down the recovery key and store it safely
4. **Click "Create Profile"** to complete setup

### Profile Security Tips

- ‚úÖ **Use strong passwords**: Mix letters, numbers, and symbols
- ‚úÖ **Keep recovery keys safe**: Store in a secure location
- ‚úÖ **Use different passwords**: Don't reuse passwords from other services
- ‚úÖ **Regular backups**: Export profile data periodically

## Managing Folders

### Adding Folders to Protection

1. **Select your profile** and enter your master password
2. **Click "Add Folder"** in the dashboard
3. **Browse and select** the folder you want to protect
4. **Confirm the operation** - the folder will be encrypted and hidden

### Understanding Folder States

- **üîí Locked**: Folder is encrypted and completely hidden
- **üîì Temporarily Unlocked**: Folder is accessible but will auto-lock
- **üîê Permanently Unlocked**: Folder is restored and removed from protection

### Unlocking Folders

#### Method 1: Invisible Keyboard Sequence
1. **Press Ctrl+Alt+V** anywhere on your system
2. **Type your master password** within 10 seconds
3. **Folders unlock automatically** for temporary access

#### Method 2: GUI Interface
1. **Open PhantomVault** application
2. **Select your profile** and authenticate
3. **Choose unlock option**:
   - **Temporary**: Folders unlock until system lock/restart
   - **Permanent**: Folders restored permanently (removes protection)

### Folder Operations

#### Temporary Unlock
- Folders become accessible in their original locations
- Auto-locks when you lock your screen or restart
- Maintains encryption and protection

#### Permanent Unlock
- Folders are restored to original locations
- Removes all encryption and protection
- Cannot be undone - use with caution

#### Lock All Temporary Folders
- Immediately locks all temporarily unlocked folders
- Useful for quick security when leaving computer

## Security Features

### Encryption Details

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC with PKCS7 padding
